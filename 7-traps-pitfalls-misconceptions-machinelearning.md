### better motivation - analysis of goals
* ask why ? what are defficiencies with current process, and will ML actually address those ?

### what ML is not
* has no insight, derives no meaning
* e.g. k-means

### what it is 
* just an algorithm like any other
* you can do anything with non ML algorithm that you can do with ML, maybe just more work

## cautions:
* overfittnig the data by just minimizing error
* 

### test/train sets
* traditionally, and still too commonly, a labeled set is split for training & testing
* recommend to check against a third 'dev' set as well to prevent over fitting
