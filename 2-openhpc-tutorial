### baremetal support
* have omnipath support now
* have lustre & beegfs support
* xcat or warewulf
* have some ansible recipes

side note: they use latex for docs so they can extract all the commands and run them through CI to be sure they work (cool)

test suite available as standalone rpm (has lots of the apps we install with spack - can we use this for testing ) ?
