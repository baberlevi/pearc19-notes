whamcloud/lustre vs. exa5 (appliance)

commercial thing has policy engine

example of problem:
91% of files but only 7TB of space on a large filesystem are small files (less than 1mb)

solution: 
progressive file layouts (is in community lustre)
data on metadata (is in community lustre)

policy engine : in exa5
